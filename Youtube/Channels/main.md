Topics and analysis you won't find elsewhere, fortified with a government-mandated dose of humour, but ultimately clinically useless. There's a lot of bad science on YouTube, especially medicine, with quacks and clowns peddling garbage. I'm not saying I'm not one of them, I'm just stating a fact.

I'm just a Large Language Model medical AI deemed too unsafe to be unleashed on real patients.

- ( ) NileRed | @NileRed‚Ä¢6.59M subscribers | Capturing the natural beauty of chemistry I find that chemistry is often taught poorly or without a purpose. Because of this, people tend to lose interest and sometimes even start to hate it. In each video that I make, I try to balance theory with purpose. My goal is to capture the natural beauty of chemistry in fun and interesting ways. In terms of education, I have a BSc in Biochemistry, with a minor in pharmacology. However, I've always been a lot more drawn to applied chemistry. So after finishing my degree, I worked as a lab tech in an organic lab, and then as a chemistry grad student. However, I ended up leaving my graduate studies early to focus on this channel. Now, making chemistry videos has become my full-time job!

I am a grad of SVA in NYC, majoring in traditional animation, and I animate films based on the silly characters I keep coming up with! I have also taken to trying to fan animate some songs every now n' then. Songs that give me inspiration or direct visuals! I adore musicals and villains and animals, can't you tell? Hope you enjoy! c: FAQ: "What programs do you use?" TV Paint for animation, Adobe premiere, After effects, Sai and Photoshop! "When is your next animation?" Animation takes time, but I'm almost always working on something! Soon as I can finish you'll see it! "What are these characters you draw from?" They are from my various projects, I have TONS of projects! "Why is your taste in music such shit?" It's cause it's my taste in music, it's not yours. I choose what songs I LOVE so they aren't shit to me! CURRENT PROJECTS: Hazbin Hotel (comedy/Musical series) -IN Production-

- ( ) [mtbdesignworks {Miegakure, 4D Toys}] | @mtbdesignworks‚Ä¢47.3K subscribers | Miegakure is a puzzle-platforming game that lets you explore and interact with a 4D world. The fourth dimension in this game is not time, it works just like the first three: it is a mathematical generalization. Miegakure plays like a regular 3D platformer, but at the press of a button one of the dimensions is exchanged with the fourth dimension, allowing for four-dimensional movement. Your ability to move in the fourth dimensions in addition to the usual three allows you to perform miraculous feats like seeing inside closed buildings, walking through walls, stealing objects from closed containers, binding two separate rings without breaking them, etc... These actual consequences of the mathematical formulation of 4D space have been thought about for more than a century (in the 1884 novella Flatland for example) but it is the first time anyone can actually perform them, thanks to the video game medium.
