The internet is not forever.

I started playing minecraft early enough to still have\* a *minecraft* account, not a mojang account. That account has since been more or less lost to the void. My brother's account was purchased with the same email, but was at that point a mojang account, and so when we had to migrate, turns out we can't really find the purchase conformation email with an irreplaceable code from **fourteen years ago**. So that's cool.

I've been playing minecraft on and off for years, but there were two main points in my life where I was *really* into it. The first was around 1.4.7, I'm not sure exactly when, but the modpack and really the thing I can credit most with shaping the games I now love and what nostalgia I have for games, is the Direwolf20 1.4.7 modpack. I never got all too far, but my first time playing any sort of modded minecraft was. At some point I'll write about D20 and what his series meant to me, but to cut it short, this was my favourite era.

Shizlanski made three videos of note for our purposes here, the only ones I remember watching were a three part series about a redpower-2 frames based mining machine, which instead of the block-breakers you'd usually see, made the incredibly smart move of using the modular force fields mod of that era to do block breaking and water removal, the thing did a 50x50x1 slice every few seconds, that was absolutely the best I'd seen. It was a great tutorial, had two videos for the breakdown and build, then a third was a breakdown of the item processing plant, all rp2 vacuum tubes, which remain my favourite item transit/sorting method to this day.

Nowadays, the channel still exists in that a youtube account of that name with 500 subscribers exists, but everything's been unlisted. All I have is the first of three, I've downloaded it, maybe I'll put it on internet archive just in case.

There's a certain poetry to the video that best exemplifies what I wanted out of games, and what I used to love, being gone. I've grown to believe that the internet should only be thought of as permanent, when it would be damaging for you. *Then* the permanence can be depended on. The odds are that Shizlanski just grew older, and didn't want to keep old videos on what may be their primary email address. I wouldn't blame them. (I've done the same)

Maybe I'll go back and play that 1.4.7 D20 pack again someday, now that I'm old enough to do it properly, not just a kid with the same seed as in D20's videos. I'm not sure what I'll think. Minecraft has moved away from what I enjoyed in it, or at least that's what I tell myself.

Wait did they do the futuristic city build with the rp2 lighting and basalt where the big disc thumbnail is burned into my head that I can't find that?
